= Copy files and set permissions

Copy the file `/etc/fstab` to `/var/tmp`. Configure the permissions so that he file `/var/tmp/fstab` is owned by `root`, belongs to group `root`, and is not executable by anyone. The user *andrew* is able to read and write `/var/tmp/fstab`. The user *susan* can neither read nor write `/var/tmp/fstab`. All other users can read `/var/tmp/fstab`.

----
# setfacl -m u:andrew:rw- /var/tmp/fstab
----

. Ensure that the user *susan* can not read, write, nor execute the `/var/tmp/fstab` file.
